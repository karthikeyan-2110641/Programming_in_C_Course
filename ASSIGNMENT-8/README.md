# Assignment 8
## Write the algorithm for questions 1 and 2. Solving all the problems is mandatory.
### 1. Write a C function that searches a given word in a line of text and returns the frequency count.Make use of pointer notation

### 2. Given multiple lines of text, parse the text to separate the tokens. A token is a word separated by a space. Store the multiple lines of text as individual strings whose maximum length is unspecified. Maintain a pointer to each string within a one-dimensional array of pointers. Identify the last line of text in some pre-determined manner. (Eg. END)

### 3. Implement Example program 11.22 (Adding two tables of numbers) (Page 11.26) of text book (Byron Gottfried). Modify the program creating another version so that each element in the table c is the larger of the corresponding elements in tables a and b (rather than the sum of the corresponding elements in a and b). a. Represent each table (each array) as a pointer to a group of one dimensional arrays, as in example 11.22. Use pointer notation to access the individual table elements.b. Represent each table (each array) as a one-dimensional array of pointers and solve the problem.

### 4. Modify the program shown in Example 11.28 (displaying the day of the year) (Page 11.37) of text book (Byron Gottfried)so that it can determine the number of days between two dates, assuming both dates are beyond the base date of January 1, 1900. (Hint: Determine the number of days between the first specified date and the base date; then determine the number of days between the second specified date and the base date. Finally, determine the difference between these two calculated values.) (optional)
