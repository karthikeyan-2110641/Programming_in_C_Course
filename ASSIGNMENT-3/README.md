## Assignment 3
### 1. Modify A1(1) to have a function CheckOddEven(num) that checks if the num is odd or even; sets a flag accordingly and return it. Use this function to find the sum of even and odd numbers in a given input of N numbers.

### 2. Write a C function ReverseNum(num) that takes integer num and reverses its digits. Let num be passed by reference.
Example:<br>
Input: 453275<br>
Output: 572354<br>

### 3. Find the product of n floating point numbers. The numbers should be read from the keyboard. You should not use any looping construct. [Hint: use recursion and decide a suitable sentinel for termination of recursion.

### 4. Factorials The factorial of an integer n, written n!, is the product of all the integers from 1 to n inclusive. The factorial quickly becomes very large; 13! is too large to store as an integer on most computers, and 35! is too large for a floating-point variable. Your task is to find the rightmost non-zero digit of n!. (1<= n <= 100) For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120, so the rightmost non-zero digit of 5! is 2. Also, 7! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 = 5040, so the rightmost non-zero digit of 7! is 4.

### 5. Write a C program that will allow a person to play a game of tic-tac-toe against the computer. Write the program in such a manner that the computer can be either the first or the second player. If the computer is the first player, let the first move be generated randomly. Write out the complete status of the game after each move. Have the computer acknowledge a win by either player when it occurs
