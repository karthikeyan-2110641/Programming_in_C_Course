### Run C program in terminal (command)

#### This will create a object file. (compile)

    gcc <filename.c> -o <outputname>
    
 #### This will run the object file.  (run)
 
    ./<outputname>


 #### to perform the 2 command at a same time use this : compile and run
 
    gcc <filename.c> -o <outputname> && ./<outputname>

##  » [PROJECT](https://github.com/karthikeyan-2110641/Programming_in_C_Course/tree/main/PROJECT%20--%20Exam%20Time%20Tabling%20in%20a%20University) (Exam Time Tabling in a University) :trophy: :sparkles:
#### Problem Definition:
   Exam time tabling problems is defined as assigning a set of exams E = e1, e2, ... ee into a
limited number of ordered timeslots (time periods) T = t1, t2, ... tt and rooms of certain
capacity in each timeslot C = C1, C2, ...Ct, subject to a set of constraints.</br>
##### Sample Constraints:
   • students should not be required to write two exams at the same time.</br>
   • The examinations must be well spaced over the timetable</br>
   • Examinations with a large number of students must be scheduled early in the examination timetable.</br>
   • Some examinations may have to be scheduled simultaneously or after other exams</br>
   • The number of students writing examinations in a particular venue and session must not exceed the capacity of the venue.</br>
   • Each student has a schedule of exams he/she must attend</br>
   • Each room has multiple features, such room size</br>
   • Each exam has a set of required features including the number of students attending it</br>
   • Rooms can only accommodate exams if they have enough seats to fit all the attending students and have at least all the features required for the exam.</br>
