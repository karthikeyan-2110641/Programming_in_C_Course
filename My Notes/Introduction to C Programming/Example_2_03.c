/* 
Note : A C program is being written to calculate the future value of an investment. The identifiers value or future_value are 
appropriate symbolic names. However, v or fv would probably be too brief, since the intended representation of these identifiers is not clear. 
On the other hand, the identifier future value of an investment would be unsatisfactory because it is too long and cumbersome.
